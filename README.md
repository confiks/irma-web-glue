# IRMA web glue

This package is a semi-drop-in-replacement for the [`irmajs`](https://github.com/privacybydesign/irmajs)
package. It takes `irmajs` and adds some magic of its own to make the whole IRMA
flow look and act like [`irma-web-frontend`](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/irma-web-frontend).

This package has been designed and tested to work with the browsers Chrome,
Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge and IE11.

## Current state

It's still pretty much in Alpha and we also need some changes in `irmajs` to
make the last bits actually work. So please check back in a couple of weeks ðŸ˜„

## Design considerations

We want to make embedding an IRMA disclosure flow in your website as simple as
we can. Because of this we have chosen a slightly simpler API than the `irmajs`
API. `irma-web-glue` intends to be your one stop shop to import in your project
and launch into good-looking IRMA flows in the web browser with zero hassle. If
you feel that we have failed in this regard, please [let us know](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/irma-web-glue/issues)
ðŸ˜‰.

## Embedding in your application

This package only contains the Javascript part of the IRMA flow, you will have
to combine it with its CSS counterpart, which is [`irma-web-frontend`](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/irma-web-frontend).
Or you can choose to write your own styling.

### The old fashioned way

There is a normal version and a minified version of the Javascripts [available
for download on Github](https://github.com/nuts-foundation/irma-web-glue/tree/master/dist)
that you can include in your own project.

If you include the `irma-web-glue.js` file in your HTML, you will have
`window.irmaWebGlue` available as a class.

### The way the cool kids do it

Alternatively, you can install it as an npm package. This can be useful if you
want to use only parts of the package and roll your own glue, if you need to
package it in some complicated way (frameworks, for example) or if you want to
stay up to date.

```bash
$ npm install nuts-foundation/irma-web-glue
```

`irmajs` is a dependency of this package, so you don't need to add that as an
extra dependency. If you want you can remove any existing dependencies on it
from your own project.

You can then import the `irmaWebGlue` class like so:

```javascript
import irmaWebGlue from "nuts-foundation/irma-web-glue";
```

### Usage

See `example/index.html` for a complete example. This section explains how the
different parts go together.

Just like `irmajs` we need an IRMA server and a request:

```javascript
// The usual configuration for irmajs
const server = "http://localhost:8088";
const request = {
  type: 'disclosing',
  content: [{
      label:        'Over 18',
      attributes: [ 'irma-demo.MijnOverheid.ageLower.over18' ]
  }]
};
```

But instead of feeding these directly to `irmajs` you hand them to a new
instance of the `irmaWebGlue` class:

```javascript
// Initialize irma-web-glue
let irmaForm = document.getElementById('irma-web-form');
let glue     = new irmaWebGlue(irmaForm, glueOptions);

glue.startFlow(server, request)
    .then(function(result) { alert("Successful disclosure! ðŸŽ‰"); console.log(result); })
    .catch(function(state) { alert("Disclosure failed in state '" + state + "' ðŸ¤¨") });
```

`irma-web-form` in this case is the ID of an element that `irma-web-glue` will
render the interface in to. To prevent flickering, it helps if this element has
already been pre-filled with the right markup:

```html
<section class="irma-web-form" id="irma-web-form">
  <header class="header">
    <p>Inloggen met <i class="irma-web-logo">IRMA</i></p>
  </header>
  <section class="content">
    <section class="centered">
      <!-- State: Uninitialized -->
      <div class="irma-web-loading-animation">
        <i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>
      </div>
      <p>EÃ©n moment alsjeblieft</p>
    </section>
  </section>
</section>
```

You can use the `glueOptions` hash to override some behaviour and all the
strings used in the front-end (for example to implement translations). See
`example/index.html` or `src/irma-web-glue.js` for more information on these
options.

## Contributing

### Compiling locally

Requires a working `git` and `npm` on your machine.

```bash
# Clone the project
$ git clone git@github.com:nuts-foundation/irma-web-glue.git

# Install dependencies
$ cd irma-web-glue
$ npm install

# Run the dev server
$ npm run serve
```

You should now have the example running on
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

This example is dependent on having a working [IRMA server](https://irma.app/docs/irma-server/)
running on port 8088.

Any change you make to the javascript will trigger a rebuild of the project
and automatically refresh in the browser.
